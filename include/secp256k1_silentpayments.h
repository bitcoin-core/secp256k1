/** This module provides an implementation for Silent Payments, as specified in
 *  BIP352. This particularly involves the creation of input tweak data by
 *  summing up secret or public keys and the derivation of a shared secret using
 *  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman. Combined are either:
 *    - spender's secret keys and recipient's public key (a * B, sender side)
 *    - spender's public keys and recipient's secret key (A * b, recipient side)
 *  With this result, the necessary key material for ultimately creating/scanning
 *  or spending Silent Payments outputs can be determined.
 *
 *  Note that this module is _not_ a full implementation of BIP352, as it
 *  inherently doesn't deal with higher-level concepts like addresses, output
 *  script types or transactions. The intent is to provide a module for
 *  abstracting away the elliptic-curve operations required for the protocol. For
 *  any wallet software already using libsecp256k1, this API should provide all
 *  the functions needed for a Silent Payments implementation without requiring
 *  any further elliptic-curve operations from the wallet.

/** The data from a single recipient address
 *
 *  This struct serves as an input argument to `silentpayments_sender_create_outputs`.
 *
 *  `index` must be set to the position (starting with 0) of this recipient in the
 *  `recipients` array passed to `silentpayments_sender_create_outputs`. It is
 *  used to map the returned generated outputs back to the original recipient.
 *
 *  Note:
 *  The spend public key named `spend_pubkey` may have been optionally tweaked with
 *  a label by the recipient. Whether `spend_pubkey` has actually been tagged with
 *  a label is irrelevant for the sender. As a documentation convention in this API,
 *  `unlabeled_spend_pubkey` is used to indicate when the unlabeled spend public key
 *  must be used.

/** Create Silent Payments outputs for recipient(s).
 *
 *  Given a list of n secret keys a_1...a_n (one for each Silent Payments
 *  eligible input to spend), a serialized outpoint, and a list of recipients,
 *  create the taproot outputs. Inputs with conditional branches or multiple
 *  public keys are excluded from Silent Payments eligible inputs; see BIP352
 *  for more information.
 *
 *  `outpoint_smallest36` refers to the smallest outpoint lexicographically
 *  from the transaction inputs (both Silent Payments eligible and non-eligible
 *  inputs). This value MUST be the smallest outpoint out of all of the
 *  transaction inputs, otherwise the recipient will be unable to find the
 *  payment. Determining the smallest outpoint from the list of transaction
 *  inputs is the responsibility of the caller. It is strongly recommended
 *  that implementations ensure they are doing this correctly by using the
 *  test vectors from BIP352.
 *
 *  When creating more than one generated output, all of the generated outputs
 *  MUST be included in the final transaction. Dropping any of the generated
 *  outputs from the final transaction may make all or some of the outputs
 *  unfindable by the recipient.

 *             - Input secret keys sum to 0 or the negation of a spend key
 *               (negligible probability if at least one of the input secret
 *               keys is uniformly random and independent of all other keys)

 *                            ordering of the recipient objects, i.e.,
 *                            `generated_outputs[0]` is the generated output
 *                            for the `secp256k1_silentpayments_recipient` object

 *                            its position in the original ordering. The
 *                            recipient array will be grouped by scan public key
 *                            in place (as specified in BIP0352), but generated
 *                            outputs are saved in the `generated_outputs` array
 *                            to match the original ordering (using the index
 *                            field). This ensures the caller is able to match
 *                            the generated outputs to the correct Silent
 *                            Payments addresses. The same recipient can be
